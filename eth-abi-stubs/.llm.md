# eth-abi-stubs Maintenance & Management Policy

## Overview

- This package provides comprehensive type stubs for both eth-abi and faster-eth-abi.
- Stubs are generated and updated automatically via the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/stubgen.yaml`.
- The stubs use a versioning scheme based on the eth-abi version pin in requirements.txt, with a date suffix (e.g., `5.2.0.20251101`).

## How stubs are generated

- Run the stubgen workflow to generate and update all stubs.
- The workflow:
  - Extracts the eth-abi version from requirements.txt.
  - Generates stubs for faster-eth-abi.
  - Duplicates and adapts stubs for eth-abi.
  - Adds overloads and type-safe signatures.
  - Prepends documentation and management comments as needed.

## Maintenance Instructions

- **When to update stubs:**
  - When eth-abi or faster-eth-abi is updated.
  - When type annotations or overloads are improved.
  - When the stubgen workflow or scripts are updated.

- **Versioning:**
  - The stubs version is always `eth-abi-version.YYYYMMDD`.
  - This ensures users can get updated stubs even if eth-abi itself has not released a new version.

- **CI Integration:**
  - The stubgen workflow will automatically create a PR with updated stubs if changes are detected.

## For maintainers

- Do not manually edit .pyi files; always use the workflow/scripts.
- Keep the README.md and this .llm.md up to date with any changes to the stubs management process.
- Ensure that the stubs remain in sync with both eth-abi and faster-eth-abi APIs and overloads.

## Special notes

- Users of eth-abi can get enhanced type checking by installing this package.
- See [../TYPE_CHECKING.md](../TYPE_CHECKING.md) for user-facing examples and details.
