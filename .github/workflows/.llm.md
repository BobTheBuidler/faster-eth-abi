# Autoclose PR Trigger Convention

This repository uses a general-purpose autoclose action for PRs created by automation.

**Trigger String Convention:**

- To associate an automation PR with a "trigger" PR for autoclose, include the following string in the automation PR's body:
  ```
  Triggered by PR: #${triggerPR.number}
  ```
  (where `${triggerPR.number}` is replaced with the actual PR number of the trigger PR)

**How it works:**

- The autoclose workflow scans open PRs for this string in their body.
- If the referenced trigger PR is closed or merged, the automation PR is automatically closed.

**Guidance for Future Actions:**

- Any future GitHub Actions or bots that create PRs and want them to be autoclosable should include this exact string in the PR body, referencing the correct trigger PR number.

This ensures consistent, reliable autoclose behavior for all automation PRs in this repository.
